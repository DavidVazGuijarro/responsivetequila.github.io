So, yeah, we started to create templates in hopes to enter to the marketplaces. We started looking for one graphical designer with the experience to produce such templates. In our three month ordeal to find one we had pretty much different results than we expected.

We started by looking for one locally, or one of our friends, for our surprise, we found that their prices were just to high. We could not afford to get one of those, we even tried to get a partnership with them, but they just didn't found the idea attractive. Maybe it's a cultural thing? Who knows...

Somehow we got the idea to get some help from the internet, and we started to look in different marketplaces, we found that they had better prices and even they made better works than them. Maybe the key it's the competition on the area, here, it's just a few of them, on sites like envato or  freelancer, you are competing with people from all around the world. This impulses you to hone your skills and put a better price. It is not even cheaper, it's faster.

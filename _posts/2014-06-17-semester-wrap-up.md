This semester was our first attempt to enter to the themes marketplace; so far the things we did right were:

- Learn which platforms are provate: some platforms only accept members within their circles, and it's pretty unknown what you should do to enter to them.
- Find where we can find feedback about our themes: The twitter account only exists to be a little helper, you should seek the people on the forums.
- Our implementation times were appropiate, we didn't took more time than the usual.
- Hire a foreign designer: local designers suffered from a rockstar syndrome, and they weren't that good anyways, we found a foreign developer that gave us bang for our buck.

The things that didn't went so well...

- We should have written more on our blog, since this experiences should help other people to pass this hurdles easily.
- So far, we had a CI script made in Ruby, but we didn't implemented it in our project for several reasons, this would have helped with things that we shouldn't have worried about, like HTML verification.
- We got stuck several months looking for a local designer, it was unsucessful and a waste of time.
- We didn't made a checklist to check to don't forget what things we should check before submiting a theme.

Last, but not least we are going to launch a marketplace for the local market (then other countries), and we are going to integreate some very cool features to make the approval process easier and clear for the users.
